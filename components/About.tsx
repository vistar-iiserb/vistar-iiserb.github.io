                        Vision for Technology and Artificial Intelligence Research (VISTAR) is the premier hub for
                        students
                        passionate about Artificial Intelligence on campus. We are committed to building an inclusive
                        and
                        dynamic community where students—from complete beginners to experienced researchers—can explore
                        and
                        contribute to the field of AI.

                        Our mission is to empower students with the knowledge, tools, and collaborative environment
                        needed
                        to engage meaningfully with AI research and development. We aim to serve as a central platform
                        for
                        AI-related learning and innovation at IISER Bhopal, bridging the gap between theory,
                        application,
                        and interdisciplinary exploration.

                        <br/> <br/>
                        We organize a diverse range of activities including hands-on workshops, student-led research
                        projects, reading groups, and foundational classes—designed to develop both theoretical
                        understanding and practical AI skills.
